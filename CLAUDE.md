You can get Rust build methods from build_manual.md file

## Build Guidelines

- Do not attempt to build after every code change
- Only build when explicitly requested by the user

## Version Management

- Version is defined in `Cargo.toml` (line 3: `version = "x.x.x"`)
- All version displays use `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")` macro to read from Cargo.toml
- To update version: only modify `Cargo.toml`, all other locations reflect automatically
- Never hardcode version strings in source code

## Theme Color System

- All color definitions must use `Color::Indexed(number)` format directly
- Each UI element must have its own uniquely named color field, even if the color value is the same as another element
- Never reference another element's color (e.g., don't use `theme.bg_selected` for viewer search input)
- Define dedicated color fields in the appropriate Colors struct (e.g., `ViewerColors.search_input_text`)
- Color values may be duplicated across fields, but names must be unique and semantically meaningful
